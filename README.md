A list of companies in Belfast that are using Go.  

# Submissions

To submit please open a pull request or send me a tweet (twitter.com/DundrumMuscles) with the following info:

The idea is to get a sense of whether or not Go is widely used within your organization, or just used by a small handful of developers. Should someone who wants to work mostly in Go be happy at your company.

- company name and what your product is/the company does

- size of the company in general, number of people in Belfast, number of teams/engineers in Belfast that use Go, etc.

- what the teams that use Go do? backend/web, open source, systems level programming, etc.

I'm not opposed to includings remote friendly companies that have a Go developers in Belfast who either meet and work in person regularly, or share a coworking space together.
